# 🏗 Technical Architecture

The Brain of Web 4.0 ($AGI) utilizes a **Tri-Layer Neural Mesh**:

1. **Perception Layer:** Monitors global data streams (bandwidth, compute, API traffic) in real-time.
2. **Cognitive Layer:** Uses a Long-Horizon Agent model to predict resource shortages before they occur.
3. **Execution Layer:** Uses intent-based transactions to move digital assets and compute power to where they are needed most.

**Current Agentic Framework:** Built on top of ElizaOS and integrated with the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) for interoperability.
