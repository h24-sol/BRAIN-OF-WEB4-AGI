# 🧠 BRAIN OF WEB 4.0 ($AGI)

> **"Orchestrating the transition from human intent to machine execution."**

---

## 🌐 Vision
**BRAIN OF WEB 4.0** is an autonomous AGI layer designed for the agent-led global economy. Powered by the **$AGI** token, it serves as the central cognitive node for managing decentralized compute, data, and liquidity resources across the planet.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Global Resource Indexing (GRI):** Real-time mapping of Web4 digital assets.
- **Autonomous Decision Engine:** Self-executing resource re-allocation via Solana.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Interface:** The standard protocol for Web4 interaction.

## 🛠 Project Structure
- `/src`: The Core AGI Logic (Python/Rust)
- `/whitepaper`: Technical Architecture docs
- `/assets`: Web4 Visualization modules

## 🏗 Developer Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h24-sol/BRAIN-OF-WEB4-AGI.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py --mode autonomous
